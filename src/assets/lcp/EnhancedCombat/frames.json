Easily hidden, these “Slag Bombs”, as Karrakin security forces were soon to call them, are capable of incinerating their close surroundings in an instant. When properly supported by a group of K-PG frames the Salamander becomes a terrifying force multiplier as it sets up Slag Bombs that are easily detonated by the smaller mechs. While the exact mechanisms behind the mutation of a K-PG into a S-PG are unknown, experts in the field of Pattern Group research suggest that the Salamander represents an evolved, mature form that all K-PGs reach given time. While verification of this theory remains outstanding, it may have staggering implications regarding the underlying nature of the liturgicode responsible for the K-PG.",
