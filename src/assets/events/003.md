# Notes as written by an automated system Shinnosuke uses:
	- We are standing in the shuttle, and also we seem to be coming in to a spire, and this city seems to take up half the coast of one of the archipelagos
	- Rosaben is the city name
	- We touch down at an oversized airport (Spaceport?)
	- It's a cargo dock for all our cargo
	- Gus reads the brochure but gets distracted by the ads
	- Cacimar is just bing chilling
		- He's also wanting to access the omninet for data on the planet regarding gods (NHPs)
		- Bro would know that one of his allies has an Omnihook
		- He asks me if there's any NHPs here
		- I know (also Vic) that if anything, UNION wouldn't intro NHPs to a new planet, and also that the colony ship sent here was sent during the First Expansion Period
		- I tell Cacimar that NHPs likely weren't around depending on how early in the 1stExpac the colony ship was sent out
	- Victoria is talking to her NHP regarding 'donâ€™t blow up my homies'
	- Shinnosuke is reviewing and re-reviewing the info from the planet, internalizing it
	- Loudspeakers say that we have arrived and we're taking out stuff with us
		- The guy on loudspeaker thanks us again and offers us beer if we meet again
	- As the doors to the shuttle open, a wave of heat hits us
	- Cacimar/Vic are fine, since they're from hot planets and they're used to it, they know how to handle it
	- The heat is stinky for me, but I can just tank it for now
	- Gus is fine and tanking it
	- The world is now open to us
	- I know that we are on the outskirts of the city, or at least not near the center, and we have to meet our contact in the spire at the end of the day
	- I check what transports we can get in this place
		- After looking around, I know that there's a few options, like the bus shuttles the workers take, the taxis, the beaches have more public transport, etc.
	- Gus tries to get a taxi?
	- The cars are pretty big
	- We have some get a taxi escapades
	- Vic offers an upgrade but he turns it down
	- We're by the beaches and start walking to the city
	- As we walk to the meeting point we take note of landmarks as we go
		- We're currently along the beachside, there's beachside vendors, mechanics, it's a lot of cool beach stuff going on
		- There are 2 little symbols on small shops, some minibuses, there's either the two or there's an affiliate logo w/ those symbols
		- Cacimar sees folks relaxing and stuff, must be a Saturday he thinks
		- Vic sees that the ship traffic around Is pretty active - there's always a ship coming/going in a very smooth order (boat ships not space ships)
	- The closer we get to the city, the more the city gets high tech
	- The sky never really goes away, it's still the same heat, maybe with some wind too
	- There is probably some climate control going on
	- Cacimar knows where we can go to get info for currency and stuff, like an information hub
	- There's waterways and gondolas, hovercars and small boats, etc and we're walking on the sidewalk
	- We arrive to the entrance to an alley, and we know our location is a bit further in
	- There is a dilapidated nondescript sign there but we can't seem to read it
	- I have coordinates and the meeting is probably inside that building with the sign
	- Shinnosuke seems a bit off w/ the darkness in the alley, his nexus opens up, before he sighs and closes it
	- Cacimar walks into the alley to check it out, and he doesn't get any feelings of danger quite yet - this place is shady tho, considering the rest of the planet
	- The door's just open, it opens inward
	- Inside appears dilapidated, and Cacimar pulls us in
	- It do be looking like a old uncared for bar
	- Alcohol!!!!!! (Cacimar looks for booze)
	- Cacimar pockets some bourbon
	- Gus has that brochure as a hat, and the brochure has the UNION logo
	- I ask for it, he gives, I unfold and look 
		- UNION has guided tours, they can convert to local currency or a guide can convert to local currency in credit
		- The delegation also hasn't been able to properly introduce their credit to the local economy so we can't get it at a bank
		- This is a big main city of this state, and the UNION delegation is on the other side of the planet
	- I go into my mind palace to review and offer the spare headset to 1 person at a time
	- Cacimar is following into the mind palace
	- Vic and Gus are piano and drinking to pass the time
	- In my mind palace, there's the same and also Tonje is here as well
	- Cacimar is talking to Tonje (OSIRIS classes like to be worshipped and also bruhhh)
	- I give him himself as an avatar, and I begin reviewing the information
	- I give him information to review as well
	- Edieutent asks to go and scout out the area w/ my nexus
		- I assent
	- During the scan, there's a room that seems like it was kinda cared for, and as it begins to scan the books, it stops at one of the rows
	- There's a book about romance, dual solar systems, The King in Yellow etc.
	- They do be looking at the bookshelf
	- Vic tries to get my attention
	- Run back to the scanning 
	- Classifications, like this alcohol is low abv and should not be drunk, this is high enough to drink, etc.
	- Get to room, Edieutent is scanning the shelf
	- He tells me the scan is missing in that area, like there's just completely nothing
	- The books getting taken out are getting scanned, but the area is BLANK
	- The area behind the partition (shelf)
	- I call Vic after she tries to get my attention
	- I tell them I need a small hole, Gus kicks the back of the shelf in and now there's a hole 
	- We verify the wall and stuff, but then Cacimar hears muffled swearing coming from outside
	- I get told by him then my left eye goes back into realspace, then I see a hooded man coming in
	- I log me and Cacimar out of the mind palace, and we chat a little bit, Cacimar is a little stunned and I explain he was in the mind palace
	- Edieutent pulls out a chair for me, Tonje pulls a chair for Cacimar, the others take a seat
	- Cacimar asks him why he's in the coat in a hot planet and bro says that his gear keeps him cold
	- I ask his name, he says his callsign is Mariner
	- I tell him about Randal's Wolves, and apparently they're known to UNION and Mariner is surprised that the group is operating here
	- I pass him the after-action report
	- Gus asks about local money, and he gives us a few cards - credit cards
	- The Agency has prepared them for us, and they don't have a limit but we gotta be reasonable 
	- He prepares to give us mission info - they're the Esker Agency
		- They're a watchdog organization, and they make sure UNION is upholding the Pillars
		- The circumstances are a bit weird here, but hopefully, it's just some rapid urbanization weirdness
	- They have a couple of agents here, one is involved in the politics here, one is in and around the docks, and a high tier agent as well. This city houses the de facto power players here, and he shows us pamphlets
		- The two previously shown symbols
		- 1 is IPS, not IPSN but Ibreliv Prospecting and Solutions
			- Hands on company
			- Mining under the ocean, building, heavy metalworks
		- 2 is Rhine Lab
			- RND type company
			- Chokehold on the tech sector here
			- Need to research their protocols and standards
	- The high tier agent was sent here to the heart of RL and IPN to see how they're reacting to UNION's arrival
	- He was supposed to ingratiate himself to the locals, and send relevant info back
	- They got some info back, like movements (political and moneywise)
	- About 4 months ago, he went silent
	- They have a system to track agents and their conditions, and they have been working since Esker's beginning. His has gone silent
	- That's where we come in
	- Our goal is to find out what happened to him, whatever it takes
		- If at all possible, get him back
	- Name/appearance of the Agent
		- He pulls out a PDA and he sends it to our terminals
		- Yoshino Kira - looks like kira from part 5 jojos
		- This was his homebase
	- I ask about standards/network protocols
		- He makes a requisition for an Omnihook to give us
		- They have a multifactor authentication omnihook setup
		- They need 1 hook to monitor, and the receivers relay between it
		- The normal hook and the authenticator have both gone silent for the agent
	- Last known location was from inside the city, they were about to set off north inland, and the last ping was north of that a week later
	- Gus brings up that it's a pretty late SaR mission
		- It's hard to get people to this planet and they have their own problems to deal with
	- This is our base of operations for the time being, and Esker has bought out this building
	- Cacimar asks if we get paid if we bring a body instead of a person
	- As far as he knows, the best the folks here have are COMP/CON units, and they're weaker than that
	- I bring up the issue of encountering an NHP that has been cascading for a while, and he replies that the system is still here so that's a promising sign
		- I know of the DEIMOS incident, but none of the others do
	- Vic asked for notable names
		- Jetta Kader (Rhine Lab)
		- Errol Berrett (IPS)
		- Names sent by Yoshino, but with no information
		- They are probably part of the team Yoshino was a part of
	- Suggested lead from Mariner says to pursue leads/jobs with one/both of the companies
		- Esker can't control what they ask us to do, but they do ask that we check in
	- I suggest that we open a bar here and try to lure in folks from IPS and from RL
	- Gus introduces himself as the king of cuisine
	- Cacimar introduces himself
	- Victoria introduces herself and her cat Gadget
	- I intro myself
		- He asks about NHPs and I passthrough AV to his cybereye and show him Tonje and Edieutent
	- We go into the room and he asks if we have been scanning around and I say we have, and then I start putting books back
	- The coloring book is missing, but so is the King in Yellow :pensive:
	- The shelf and the wall behind slide down, then there's an elevator
	- He beckons us into the elevator and we file in, he apologizes for the deep scan resistance
	- There elevator goes down for about a minute
	- The doors start to open and we can smell mechanical oil, burning metal, some smoke, etc. and there's a printer setup here? 
	- These are top of the line printers per the agreements with Esker and UNION and we should really REALLY not tell UNION about this printer setup being here
	- This is a shared area between some groups but 
	- There is also an exit to the drainage system for the city that can take us everywhere in the city almost
	- The printer stock we're getting is all we get for the next month
	- He opens up a communications channel w/ me and gives me the data needed to operate this facility
	- We go back up and he passes us his contact info
	- He passes a bundle of keys to Gus and tells him it's keys to the bar
	- He then leaves
	- We have a Missing Agent clock!!!!! 
	- I gotta go make amends with the taxi guy
	- For the next session, we get 2 downtime actions
		- 1 for getting closer to the missing agent
		- 1 just for anything
	- Split 2 and 2? Vic and Gus for IPS and Cacimar and Shinnosuke for RL
	- END OF SESSION
	- Post credit scene I go back to the taxi driver and I pay him for damages and the stuff
