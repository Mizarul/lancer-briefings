• Some of the people from our employer have gone missing on Ibrylith
	• They want us to see what's going on
	• The journey has been uneventful - 3 months of boring on a cargo freighter
	• We been drilling, being helpful, and maybe doing our projects
	• The food here sucks (Aliens reference)
	• However, we have been busy!!! Lots of the crew get drunk or high to pass the time but we're built different
	• Camera pans through the ship to us!!! 
		○ Victoria (Chinchin)
			§ She been making a little space for herself, and she's got a new compartment in the mech for her cat!!!
			§ Training the cat to not be scared of explosions
			§ Kitty starts nuzzling some C4 :relieved:
				□ Male kitty!!!!!!! 
			§ New homie says hi? Says the cat will make a great bomb
			§ Reaches out to me
				□ Over the last few months, I got messages if I can help Victoria w/ her mech talking to her
				□ I say yea ofc
		○ Now to me!!!!
			§ I explain my stuffs about my OSIRIS
			§ I get a ping from an old contact in SSC regarding our contractor, giving me the info I had from Miza beforehand

		○ Gus in cargo hold 5 being confronted by another crew member
			§ Bro has the stuff? Bro also has the stuff
			§ They be exchanging something fr
			§ It's a teddy bear!!!!!!!! It winks at Gus!!!!!!!
			§ It aint what Gus wanted apparently but bro still wants the goo
			§ He fights for the goo but Gus holds him back, tells him double later
			§ Bro says they'll get the real fluff to him later, we make planetside in a day or two
			§ Gus punches the wall and leaves both the room and the 'fluff'
			§ As he leaves he hears some folks gossipping about Shinnosuke
			§ He joins in a little bit then the crew member chest bumps him
		○ Cacimar asks for Gus and Gus immediately sprints towards Cacimar's location
			§ Cacimar is having a rough time w/ his mech? The drones are just bing chilling
			§ Bro has done everything he can think of for troubleshooting but he can't seem to bring everything in line
			§ Cacimar has not been doing a whole lot tbh
			§ Bro has been rating his fights? Also was in contact w/ Andromache telling his tale as a ??? (those who go offworld)
			§ While in the simulation lounge, he decided to go w/ Hydra from White Witch

			§ We will be meeting in cargo hold 15
			§ Bro wants to read the document before signing off lmaoooo

			§ They have an exchange
	• Back to me walking to Victoria
	• I have been walking for a while and I am taking a quick breather and drinking water and the deckhands keep giving me weird looks
	• Stay cool???? (22)
	• My ass CATCHES my breath
	• I arrive at Victoria's hideout in the cargo holds
	• There's a gap in the crates that's her little hideout
	• I also see while getting there a deckhand on a scooter with more papers and stuffs
	• I knock to announce myself to Vic
	• Gadget is the cat and he's playing w/ more stuff
	• Cat angry w/ me apparently? Bro makes himself big
	• I enter and Vic is still having the voices from the earpiece
	• Vic's NHP is called Deidara?? That's rad?????????
	• Deidara is a her :wink:
	• They do be talking about explosions but I only hear Vic's part
	• As we come out of the hiding hole, I see that I have stepped on a mine and it hasn't gone off
	• The mine should trigger when pressure goes away
	• We do be making attempts to get me off this mine
	• We get me off this mine :relieved:
	• We are getting our mechs to the disassembler
	• Deidara is looking at us
	• I ask to take Raison D'etre myself down since it's a small chassis and I wanna keep him whole
	• Cacimar seems to be getting a feeling?
	• As we get in/command our mechs, Cacimar feels like something is about to happen
		○ The music starts and he can feel that he needs to prepare for a battle
	• He tells us he got a bad feeling
	• We get battle ready
	• All of a sudden alarms start
	• Pirates incoming, scuttle ready compartments if necessary
	• Prepare the important cargo to the front, then we start getting pounded by explosions and pings
	• I demand the deckhands to stand their ground and secure the cargo
	• Manjuari demands they man their stations as well
	• Vic knows that the explosions seem to be targeting the generators on the ship
	• We all begin moving as one unit forwards, escorting the cargo on the way to the reactor
	• We are under attack by Randal's Wolves
	• There's a MASSIVE mech here in the reactor
	• Amorous Titanium greets us as we enter (a pirate)

	• ESCORT - 8 rounds to get the payload to the end of the room
	• Combat!!!!!!
	• When I use hurl into the duat Tonje is out and about fucking w/ the enemy systems
	• FLUFFY IS BIOLOGICAL????
	• Amorous Titanium's pilot seems to have teleported out as his(?) mech is destroyed
	• We get through the combat a bit battered
	• Halfway through the reactor got hot as we after burnered out

	• Half the ship is scuttled/spaced
	• Pirates are going to the jettisoned parts to scavenge
	• As we enter the front, we see an archipeligic planet
	• We are arriving!!!!!! 
	• We look out the front and Vic/Gus see that this planet does not have ice caps and it will be HOT and WET on the surface, they also see that there's some ships with UNION markings going up and down, and they seem to be starting to build something in orbit 
	• As we arrive, another deckhand comes along
	• We gotta get our guys out to the front printer
	• We will be going down to the city of Rosaben in a cargo shuttle
	• The shuttle leaves in about 30 minutes
	• Vic asks me to help get the NHP out
	• I connect and eject the Casket, but it spikes me a bit in the mind and says DON’T TOUCH ME YOU FILTHY (gets ejected)
	• I collapse to my knees w/ a nosebleed :pensive but again:
	• Cacimar is looking at the newborn god
	• I took 3 stress :pensive:
	• We get to the funny city!!!!!! 
	• SESSION END
