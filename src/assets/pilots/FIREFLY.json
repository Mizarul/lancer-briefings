    "history": "<p>Victoria had been found as an orphan on a remote planet far away from Union territory. Neither she nor her new \"family\" knows where she came from or who and where her parents are. The man who took her in is Norman, one of the best mechanics on his planet. Why he took her in remains a mystery, perhaps even to himself. Maybe he wished to have a daughter after his wife passed away many years ago, or maybe he just took pity on the little orphan he found at the local junkyard. Nevertheless, he was a good and caring \"father.\"</p><p>Due to Norman's profession, Victoria learned the life of a mechanic from a very young age. She started assisting him with his work early on and showed a great interest in creating and inventing new tools in Norman's workshop. Her knack for inventing often led to unexpected results, with many of her creations turning into unintentional makeshift explosives or malfunctioning contraptions. Despite her struggles with traditional repairs and maintenance, her true talent lay in her innovative designs and the ability to think outside the box. Over time, Victoria developed a fascination with explosions, seeing them as a powerful force of creation and destruction that mirrored her own inventive spirit.</p><p>One day, when Victoria was 14 years old and searching the junkyard for new materials for her latest \"invention\" – a small drone with robotic arms to work on large machines without the need for climbing – she found something big buried under a tremendous amount of junk. By accidentally causing a junk avalanche, she revealed an Everest-type mech.</p><p>She had read about these mechs in some of the learning books she had from Norman and thought it would be cool to get it moving. After a preliminary analysis, most parts of the mech seemed to be potentially functional with some minor adjustments and improvements. Eager to try it out, Victoria climbed into the cockpit to see if she could somehow get it running. The moment she sat inside the mech was amazing for her; she couldn't quite understand it herself, but it felt like she was born to be in this machine. She had never felt so happy in her life.</p><p>At first, operating the mech felt very intuitive for her, and she was able to take a few steps. Unfortunately, she had no real idea how to properly operate the machine and accidentally activated some kind of boost system, causing her to crash into a nearby wall at high speed. This crash caused the already broken mech to fall apart completely and resulted in a small explosion, setting the junkyard on fire. Victoria was badly injured in the accident but was rescued by the local emergency forces. After many days in critical condition at the hospital, she survived, losing only her right arm and left leg and gaining numerous lasting scars on her body.</p><p>During her recovery, Victoria's desire to become a mech pilot grew stronger. She decided not just to be any pilot, but one of the best. She wanted to become a Lancer. When she shared her decision with Norman, he was dismayed. He had always envisioned a different future for her – one that involved the safety and predictability of running the workshop. Norman was worried about the dangers and uncertainties that came with being a Lancer, and he couldn't understand why Victoria would choose such a perilous path.</p><p>\"Why would you throw away everything we've built here?\" Norman asked, frustration and worry evident in his voice. \"You have a real talent for this work, Victoria. You could have a stable life, a good life.\"</p><p>Victoria understood his concerns, but she couldn't ignore her passion. \"I know, Norman. But I don't want just a good life. I want to do something extraordinary. I want to make a difference.\"</p><p>Despite his reservations, Norman continued to support Victoria, even though it pained him to see her pursue such a dangerous path. She stayed at Norman's workshop for many years, saving as much money as she could to build herself a proper Everest mech. First, she built herself a mechanical prosthesis for her right arm, then she started learning as much as she could about piloting and mechs. Using the remnants of the crashed mech from the junkyard, she built her own mini version of the machine to train in until she could afford to get a real one. Throughout these years, her inventions continued to produce small explosions, and she began to incorporate controlled blasts into her designs, seeing them as a signature of her work.</p><p>At the age of 20, she left her \"home\" and set out into the galaxy to earn money as a mercenary and mechanic. She never let any opportunity pass to test and train her piloting skills, doing whatever it took to become worthy of the title of a Lancer.</p><p>Norman watched her leave with a heavy heart, proud of her determination but fearful for her safety. He could only hope that one day, she would find what she was looking for and return home safe.</p>",

With TLALOC installed and operational, a pilot can trust that their back is always covered, and every possible advantage exploited.<br>TLALOC clones are often stereotyped as hasty and impetuous, and they are well-known for having superiority complexes. Despite this, they are some of the most stable NHP clones. Leading subjectivity theorists suggest that the wide portfolio of control and sense of domination given to TLALOC units encourages a sense of contentment with their work and subjectivity parameters – as a result, they have a much longer cascade window. Thus far, this theory is consistently reproducible across all TLALOC units, although there is no similar correlation among other mil-spec NHP lines."
