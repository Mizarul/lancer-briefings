    "history": "<p>A warrior of the Yuisa tribe from planet Andernach. After most of the tribe was slaughtered during a war of independence against the Guantuan Empire, most of the survivors sought refuge within the Republic of Maboca, the main contact of Union within the planet of Andernach. It is not uncommon for Yuisan warriors to serve as Andernachian Lancers for Union, or for some other well paying organization. Yuisan warriors believe that there is no true death, as they simply reincarnate into the tribe once their previous body perishes, resulting in a hyper aggressive warrior culture. Now most Yuisan warriors seek deaths among the stars, so that their souls may reach higher glory than ever before.</p>",

This sideways attack evades most electronic countermeasures by targeting the subcognitive networks of enemy drones. Once inside a network, PUPPETMASTER spreads ontological-kill memes like wildfire through enemy swarms, eventually following the network traces back to their origin and corrupting the parent nexus."

Utilizing a new-model ontologic bridge framework, ADJUTANT allows for the use of selected simulant/reflex architectures to be uploaded to an engrammatic matrix for compatible pilot integration along both first- and second-tier neural processes. Long-term effects of repeated engrammatic synthesis are currently unknown, but early feedback is promising with test pilots reporting minimal difficulty expressing previously unheld aptitudes.</p>"
