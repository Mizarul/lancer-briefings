    "history": "<p>Shinnosuke was born into a well-to-do family in the Sierra Madre line, comfortably within Smith-Shimano space. He grew and was groomed for following in his parents' footsteps - researchers pushing the bleeding edge of what is - and can be - human. His father specialized in bio-organics, augmentations, and genetics, while his mother specialized into cybernetics, human-machine interfacing, and computer engineering, leaving Shinnosuke to study meta-physics, paracausality, and NHPs. Shinnosuke had an honest and stimulating, if over-managed, upbringing, completing primary, secondary, and some post-secondary education with honors. While studying, Shinnosuke grew fond of birds, even taking a couple as pets. Some time into his college years, his worldview shattered like glass. In a joint project with his mother and father, Akiba and Bjorn, Shinnosuke was working on integrating both sensory data and biological data with NHP input, straddling the fence of the First-Contact Accords. During this process, no-one was supposed to be in contact with any of the affected parts - they were all separated in secure environments. A cavalcade of issues arose, bringing the NHP to cascade temporarily, lashing out and connecting those objects it impacted. Among the objects struck was Shinnosuke, taking the blow meant for his father. Six eternal seconds this connection lasted, during which Shinnosuke's mind was opened to the NHP's everything - a perfectly incomprehensible mess. Amidst the ordered chaos, he begun to think of humanity and it's place among NHPs, beings with potential to rival entire star systems, and just as quickly as it began, emergency shutoffs and paracausal cages locked down the entire facility. Shortly afterwards, Shinnosuke received several messages at his omninet address - his projects were on hiatus until further notice, all research materials related to the incident were sent in their entirety to his planet's governing body, and a curious message from an unknown sender. In this unmarked message, he saw glimpses back into that cacophony of silence he experienced in the lab, as well as finding a license he didn't have ready for use. Inside, the means to travel and to print a basic chassis, and travel he did - Shinnosuke decided it was time to do some soul searching after his experience. </p>",

In lay terms, Union let the Other grow. The resulting parasubjectivity, OSIRIS, remains one of the few new prime NHPs developed to date.<br>OSIRIS proved far more capable than the Union Science Bureau’s most imaginative blue-sky predictions. Where INSTINCT’s Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would – eventually – allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB’s data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br>Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime’s subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders. They often regard their pilots as witnesses, displaying both disdain and marked desperation for approval, adulation, or awe."

When plugged in, users can access a comprehensive, fully interactive alternate-reality interface with direct omninet access, making navigating – or hacking – local and networked systems as easy as wishing it so (of course, you must be careful: by opening up your mind to the digital, you may face dangers other, less enhanced people are ignorant of).",

Using breeding-analogous methods defined by established bioengineering doctrines, SSC developed the sylph undersuit – sterile, living sylphs grown as envelopes and fitted to their owners. The sylph bonds to its wearer, forming a symbiotic relationship: the sylph is sustained by the host’s waste products, in return protecting the host from a range of hostile environmental factors.<br>These semi-biological, skin-tight undersuits can be worn for extended periods. They are translucent, semi-liquid, and able to be stored when not in use, conforming to whatever container they are placed in. They clean the host’s body, aid natural healing processes, and eliminate waste. As desired, segments can become opaque, change color, or take on a new texture. Sylph undersuits can cover the host’s head, sealing against vacuum, providing protection against radiation, and filtering air or liquids, even providing the ability to breathe water for a limited time.",
