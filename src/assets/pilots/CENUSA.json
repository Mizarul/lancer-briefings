    "history": "<p><strong>Eka Seitsemas</strong> is an Ex-Priest of a defunct cult, hailing from a barren desert world in an unnamed system.</p><p>Eka was made to be a Lancer Pilot, an illegal flash-clone of dubious origin, indoctrinated and groomed to bring the firey message of his faith to the yet-to-be believers and ash and soot to those deemed heretics.</p><p>Within the system the cult started and expanded their operations. They uprooted and replaced the prelevant powerstructures with those of the all-holy \"Meesiah\". Often through fire and exploitation, ashes to ashes.</p><p>Eka, then \"1\" \"7\", was one of the vanguards, often leading the charges and destroying whatever was deemed heretical. As such, he often witnessed horrors but thought nothing of it, for they were heretics and the Messiah was justice, dust to dust.</p><p>But his faith was shaken when inside the flames of war, on the last planet in the system, he fought a Lancer who looked eerily similar to himself. Whether it was the original or another clone he did not know, but as he won the fight, his assumed brother spoke a trigger word: <strong>Cenusa</strong>.</p><p>Within a flash of memories that seemed to last forever, he remembered faces, battles, emotions, the Messiah. They revealed to him the destination they would be heading to, Sol enflamed, humanity reduced to the sand within desert winds they all hailed from.</p><p>\"1\" \"7\" had changed with the aftershocks, no longer the Priest spreading the faith but also not fully changed to the man in his memories. He turned on his false brothers, the destruction they wrought together laid bare as atrocities before him.</p><p>He joined the local powers, begged them to let him aid in returning the fires to the sands. His memories told him that the Union would surely destroy the Messiah along with his faith, but until they arrived he had to fight against them with any alliance he could make, no matter how shaky.&nbsp;</p><p>Union arrived, the cult was no more. Ashes to ashes.</p><p>\"1\" \"7\" proved himself valuable, was reeducated within Union. A new name for coming battles \"Eka Seitsemas\" , dust to dust.</p><p>But his memories tell him, the cult is still alive and they <em>must be ereased from memory</em>. <em>No ashes and dust, only oblivion</em>.</p>",
