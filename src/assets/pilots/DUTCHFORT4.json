    "history": "<p>From the planet Mamaceqtaw (ma-ma-chay-tau), Dutch was raised by her single father in his owned and operated mechanic shop, Gary's Mechs &amp; Repairs. There, she learned the ins and outs of most mechanical things, including vehicles and mechs. She had a stronger liking to mechs, even going through the process of building her own while maintaining others' as a side hustle. </p><p>As is common  practice with her and her peoples, nature and wildlife is crucial to their continued way of life. They believe in taking what nature provides, and returning what is left over back to nature as thanks. They are most famously known for their wild rice, a common food item that can be found in any store thanks to the peoples of Mamaceqtaw.<br><br>During her late teens, Dutch found that her father had been murdered, and found that (x) had been responsible for it. Devastated by this, she gave the shop over to close family friends before leaving her home, life, and everything she's ever truly known, to seek out revenge and bring justice forth by her own hands for her father. Through the years of trying to hunt (x) down, Dutch discovered that she found a love and joy in protecting those and being their shield, their wall. She became less bitter and grief-stricken, she found friends in unusual circumstances who became her new kin.</p><p>She has fought alongside others for protecting nature, wildlife, and the overall importance of the environment on not only her home planet, but many others as well. This is crucial, because she was raised with the knowledge and appreciation of what the natural and indigenous life has to offer, and that is something corporations can never hope to replicate for their greedy intentions.</p><p>Now, at 30 years of age, Dutch has softened her heart and become a joyous soul who has endless love to give. She understands, now, that this is what her father was to her, and so she shall honor him by doing the same. A small part of her, however deep within her heart, there is still a desire to get the one who killed her dad to begin with. </p>",
